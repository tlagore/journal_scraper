{"title": "Improving the Teacher Hiring Process through the Combination of Teacher Quality and Employee Selection Research", "author": "Kimbrel, Laurie A.", "journal": "AASA Journal of Scholarship & Practice", "doi": ", v15 n4 Win 2019", "abstract": "School administrators must ensure that every child has access to high quality instruction, making it imperative that only the teacher candidates with the greatest probability of success are hired. Most teacher selection practices are neither valid nor reliable and do not accurately predict job performance. Teacher hiring processes and therefore, teacher quality, can be greatly improved if administrators consider the application of recent research regarding the beliefs and behaviors of teachers with high impact on student learning in conjunction with employee selection research from the fields of management and the social sciences. This article provides direction for practitioners to utilize research-based practices to improve teacher hiring processes as well as implications for future research.", "keywords": ["teacher selection", "educational quality", "administrators", "instructional effectiveness", "teacher attitudes", "teacher behavior", "academic achievement", "teacher effectiveness", "teacher improvement", "predictor variables"], "extra_details": {"ERIC Number:": " EJ1204455", "Record Type:": " Journal", "Publication Date:": " 2019", "Pages:": " 19", "Abstractor:": " As Provided", "ISBN:": " N/A", "ISSN:": " EISSN-1931-6569"}}
